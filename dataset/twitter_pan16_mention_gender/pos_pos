the challenge is talk about one thing that can't tweeted to the world .
well , hello . How all is well .
absolutely . Replicate and extend is a great model for building a good research plan ! #replichi
as this conversation attest , it is hard to keep everyone else interested in the conversation . G+ would work better .
awesome work . Can't wait to see the next steps of this in products .
hell banning is my favorite . Not enough people know about this . Delicious made good use of it .
indeed , quotes can often be taken out of context , but the spirit of the interpretation wasn't far off from the OP .
its a function of how many active users you follow and how much effort you invest in the social network as an user .
only cliff's tweets needs prior approval .
sure is . She worked on this with sian lindley .
the original post http://t.co/rvnM3SxVBm seems to be quoted verbatim by these new outlets , so why the backpeddling ?
this is the Pamela Hinds seminar that you are referring to , eh ?
we were posing , not sure if we answered questions . Dodged is more like it !
wordle is the standard goto option .
yeah cliff's talk would be bleeped out every other sentence .
you should be able to invite someone with just an gmail address . But yes , it can be complex .
you should be able to invite someone with just an gmail address . But yes , it can be complex .
algorithm could highlight the user with higher influence score .
also , don't tweet Joe konstan's address or medical problem !
because only a very small number of devices were given out . Very very small , no more than 3 digits .
because you can't even get it anywhere right now . It's by invitation only .
didn't know #glassing is a verb already .
exactly ! Also the reason that diversity creates beauty .
excellent point . She was robbed .
fplusme fail . Try : https://t.co/g1c7FhUvYO
have not yet received the router from almond yet .
have you been following the details ? It's pretty amusing .
he just slipped into a coma .
he was an amazing man .
hmmm . Interesting point . Will observe using this new lens for a while .
if you believe in the internet service model , then you have to give trust to someone eventually . Question is who .
if you believe in the internet service model , then you have to give trust to someone eventually . Question is who .
interesting . Never heard some of these things .
it's been a while since I've used an iPhone . Thanks .
its an sync posting service . It isn't run by g+
looking for dan weld . can you bring him back to the apartado room ?
most of those bots fight spam or deliver automated messages , so for understanding native user behavior we filter .
my research actually shows that most ppl don't pay attention to those annotations . Ironic .
no and no , for now . I'll ask to get the slides released by Google .
no kidding ! It was surreal .
no problem . Been thinking how to post in g+ so that it shows up nicely in twitter . Want finer control of truncation algo .
not sure why the attachment is missing . It was http://t.co/HZw8RBOiwp
often in our analysis , the first step is trying to filler out the bots as they are often spam .
oh , Jaime ! That's a good challenge for all talks .
only if you trust your kids and coworkers won't play a practical joke on you !!
point taken . But maybe not with twitter 140 char limit .
really ?! I had no idea . Sounds like time for some Google searches .
reminds me of work we did in 2009 called Eddi that summarizes your tweet stream .
sigh . Don't know whom to believe .
smart chip isn't French . They are also cheap . Just a problem with infrastructure of existing card readers .
thanks . I'm in that room already .
thanks for the feedback . I use g+ mainly , and find twitter's ability to have conversation limited . Not liking 140 char limit .
thanks for the link . Will retweet .
that one , no . Canon .
that was a big event . John have chosen thus far too be much more low key . Either way , it's incredibly sad .
that's a tough problem , usually solved using models of network diffusion .
that's strange . Just tried the link and it works fine both in the g+ app as well as chrome .
that's very nice for you to say . John is amazing guy .
the T-Mobile $30 data plan ? Awesome ! Good to know .
there have been papers somewhat on the same theme . There is also that book about " the selfish gene " .
they sure do .
totally agree .
true enough . Got a bug to file against the team .
truly amazing .
unfortunately no . I'm heading to mpls to see my advisor john riedl who is at the tail end of his battle with melanoma .
using managefliter to cross post from g+ . I find twitter too limiting . Doesn't clicking thru to g+ help avoid paywall issue ?
wait till she is sixteen ! . Just kidding .
we didn't study that , so I don't know .
welcome ! Let's chat . What team are you joining ?
where did you go ?
where were you all week ? Cliff Lampe was missing too , which raised suspicions .
why do you think steel is better than aluminum ?
works for me . Are you on gplus ? It redirects to a post there .
would have been possible last nite . next time !
would have to do another experiment to answer that question .
yeah , damn typo .
yes , lame . Even the paper that talked about circle management did not talk about g+circles .
yes . Look for me around the Google booth during there breaks .
you mean academic papers ?
