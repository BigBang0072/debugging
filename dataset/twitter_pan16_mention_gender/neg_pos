Was feeling tired running , but seeing good friends gave me my second wind . Also , humming Enterprising Young Men helped http://tiny.cc/dMoOr
Watch Dogs looks pretty badass . I love the multiplayer idea of each person taking a different part in the story .
Watching Bruce Lee's Fists of Fury and Jet Li's Fist of Legend back-to-back . Now I just need that crappy Jackie Chan version .
Watching Gozu . May never look at a ladle in the same way .
Well , Last . Fm on Xbox reaffirms my eclectic music taste by recomending both Chris Cross and Kriss Kross .
Well , glad I didn& #039 ; t get stuck in this Starcraft 2 queue . http://twitpic.com/29754c
Well nintendo is dead . Good Night #E3
Welp , 2 hours early for my flight and southwest won't let me transfer .
Welp , blue phantoms can't use Estus flasks . Sorry host dude .

Went to Oddball Films last night http://t.co/VpRMWb7v The Archer theme was playing during a Delta Airlines promo http://t.co/jI4pzybd
When people stop dreaming they become stagnant . Even if the goal is unrealistic or insane , I'll still fight for it .
While I'd love to check out the 3DS , I don't have the spare hours to sit in a line .
Why can't I find pictures of Final Fantasy 5 Monks !?
Why did Dragons Dogma's English theme song retool lines about television and phone calls ? It could probably work in a high fantasy setting .
Why does a British appliance commercial have the music to Robocop on Gameboy ? http://t.co/1ab2xV47
Why is everyone scheduling BBQs and Super Bowl parties at 10pm !?... Oh right , time zone difference .
Why is gangnam style even on CNN ? Must be a slow news day .
Wii U : Play games with your ass . #GameSpotE3
With Ninja Gaiden 3 I can Ryu on WiiU with you in a multiplayer slew .
Woke up in LA , hopped on a plane to NorCal , dropped off bags at home , watched Prometheus IMAX 3D in a packed theatre , now for sleep .
Woke up smelling of spilled beer and Konami beef . What a night .
Worst thing in Final Fantasy 14 so far are quests that are not won by combat or fetching items , but by emoting randomly .
Wow , that's quite a start to making Gameling games . Guess I'm getting this Game Dev Tycoon ting . http://t.co/vuSZJTB5QW
Wow , the new Wacom Inkling looks impressive : http://t.co/Do0iUcX
Wow , the new Wacom Inkling looks impressive : http://t.co/Do0iUcX
Wow I come back to the hotel and my bathroom has a huge xbox ad in it . Go marriott .
Wuh ? Even Dragon Age has plot battles you're meant to lose ? I always hate that design .
Yes , one more interview . This time looking at Binary Domain http://l.gamespot.com/jgTWUj
Yes Ghost Recon jazz hands .
You can't get to some places in Star Wars the Old Republic if you decided to be muscular or fat . Bioware hating on wide people .
Yup 49ers are officially dead .
heading down to LA for the craziness that is E3 .
